Live site url: https://lfw-fm-rest-countries.vercel.app

## Description
A Single page application fetching country data from [REST Countries API](https://restcountries.eu/).
This was a challenge build from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/).

## The challenge (From Frontend Mentor)
Your challenge is to integrate with the [REST Countries API](https://restcountries.eu) to pull country data and display it like in the designs.

You can use any JavaScript framework/library on the front-end such as [React](https://reactjs.org) or [Vue](https://vuejs.org). You also have complete control over which packages you use to do things like make HTTP requests or style your project.

Your users should be able to:

- See all countries from the API on the homepage
- Search for a country using an `input` field
- Filter countries by region
- Click on a country to see more detailed information on a separate page
- Click through to the border countries on the detail page
- Toggle the color scheme between light and dark mode *(optional)*
